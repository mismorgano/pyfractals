# Visualizer for Escape-Time fractals


## Overview

Due to my complex analysis course and because one of my classmates made the same,
I wanted to make a fractal visualizer.

It will be basically be based on Escape-Time fractals like the 
[Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and the 
[Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).
